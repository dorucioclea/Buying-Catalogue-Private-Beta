# SharePoint Provider.

The sharepoint provider sits as a layer of abstraction between the Frontend API and the autogenerated code created by Swagger CodeGen.

## Fake SharePoint Provider

Setting the environment variable `SHAREPOINT_PROVIDER_ENV=test` will cause the module to provide an instance of the FakeSharePointProvider instead of the RealSharePointProvider.

## RealSharePointProvider

Not Setting the environment variable `SHAREPOINT_PROVIDER_ENV` will cause the module to default to an instance of the RealSharePointProvider. Setting the flag to anything other than `test`, like `SHAREPOINT_PROVIDER_ENV=development` or `SHAREPOINT_PROVIDER_ENV=production` will also export an instance of the RealSharePointProvider.


## Important Note.

This Abstraction layer is only really for use with the dotnet backend API.
